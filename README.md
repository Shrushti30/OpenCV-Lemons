# OpenCV-Lemons
## Segmenting and Counting Lemons in an Image

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `OpenCV-Lemons/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook final.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook final.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### About

Segmenting and Counting lemons using OpenCV tools. Trained Custom Haar Cascade using Imagenet Datasets (see Custom_HaarCascade folder).
Results could be improved with more data, gpu.
